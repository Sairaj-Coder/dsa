# striver1-dsa Project

## Overview
The `striver1-dsa` project is designed to demonstrate the use of various data types in C++. It includes examples of character and string handling, as well as input/output operations. The project serves as a practical introduction to basic C++ programming concepts.

## Files
- **datatypes&input1.cpp**: This file contains C++ code that showcases:
  - The use of different data types.
  - Handling of characters and strings.
  - Input and output operations, including reading multiple integers and using strings with and without spaces.
  - Examples of ASCII values for characters.

## Usage
To run the project, compile the `datatypes&input1.cpp` file using a C++ compiler and execute the resulting program. Follow the prompts to see how different data types and input methods work in C++.

## Requirements
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).
- Basic understanding of C++ programming.

## License
This project is open-source and available for anyone to use and modify.
